# Sorting Algorithms with Hashing Technique

This code provides a comprehensive implementation of two popular sorting algorithms: heap sort and merge sort. It integrates a unique approach by utilizing a simple hashing function in conjunction with sorting to demonstrate an example of combining different techniques. The hashing function is applied to elements before sorting, illustrating an integration of data processing methods.
